Benis General JS Helper Functions.

log: log something -> puts it to the console and to an array (__loadJSON.array)    
You can add your own log function to the log engine with log.function(text, loglevel)  

__defined: Check if a variable is defined.    

$_GET: Get a GET parameter from the browser url.    

__loadJSON: Load a JSON file.   

__jsonUpperCase: Convert all json value names to upper case. (Not the values themselves.)  

__addSlashIfNot: Add a slash to a directory string if there is none at the end.    

__shortenDirectory: Remove overhead dir/..-combinations from a directory string.    

Not much but very helpful. :)  

Also, BeJQuery.js can be used in combination with jQuery to shorten some things out. Explanation comes later.
